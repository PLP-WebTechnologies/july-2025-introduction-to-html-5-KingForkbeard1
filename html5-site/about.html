<h2>About This Project</h2>
<p>This website is a hands-on HTML5 learning project created as part of the PLP Web Technologies course (July 2025). It aims to demonstrate best practices in web development using semantic HTML5, accessibility principles, and basic SEO techniques.</p>

<p>Throughout this project, we explore how developers can build inclusive websites that not only look good but also perform well on search engines and are usable by everyoneâ€”including people using assistive technologies.</p>
